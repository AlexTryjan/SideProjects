TicTacToe
=========

What started out as a simple, computer chooses randomly game
of TicTacToe created for my AP CompSci class my senior year 
turned into an "unbeatable" game of chess when I found myself
bored after class my freshman year at Case Western Reserve Univ.
(The code itself is not so attractive, but I have decided to push
it here anyway to showcase what I do when bored :P )
